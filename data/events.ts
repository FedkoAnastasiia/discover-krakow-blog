The traditional competition for the statuette of St Jacek is held during the 21th Pierogi Festival. The Small Market Square fills with exhibitors competing for the audience award - the Casimir the Great statuette - by serving up classic and modern boiled, fried or baked versions of everyone's favourite delicacy.
